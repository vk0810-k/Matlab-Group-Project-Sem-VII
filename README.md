### The human coronavirus has a cunning nature of fast spreading and infecting people not only via droplets but it also remains persistant on various surfaces upto several days. Thus, it is required to isolate all possible patients from public places. Since COVID-19 has a rather long incubating period  it makes impossible (without special laboratory tests) to detect it on early stages. Thus, worldwide lockdown and self-isolation of population is a need in the current situation. Social distancing is the only way if not to stop the coronavirus completely but at least to slow down its pace in the world.
